**Flash Talk: Protein Synthesis**

Description:  Using 3D Molecular Models, Paper/Pencil or any other model that you come up with, prepare a 3-minute “flash talk” discussing how the Central Dogma expresses genes. A flash talk is a brief speech or presentation, intended to grab the attention of the audience and convey key information in a quick, insight, and clear manner. In your flash talk you must use the origami models to help in your presentation.

Essential Question: How is gene expression accomplished using the Central Dogma?

Purpose: The purpose of this flash talk is for you (& your partner if you choose) to demonstrate your knowledge of the Central Dogma and how genes are expressed

Who is your Audience: Your flash talk should be directed at a person (or people) who slightly understand how the Central Dogma works for expression genes through transcription and translation. 

Your 3-minute flash talk MUST:
1.	Explain the structures of the Central Dogma including all key structures.
2.	Explain the process of transcription including the role of DNA, mRNA, nucleus, RNA polymerase, and the structure of RNA.
3.	Explain how pre-mRNA is processed into mRNA before leaving the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell.
4.	Explain the process of translation including the role and structure of tRNA, Ribosomes, Codons, anti-codons, Amino Acids, Start Codons, Stop Codons.

That’s a lot to pack into 3 minutes! So your script for the talk needs to be tight and you need to choose your words well.  (NOTE: 3 minutes of speech is about 450 words of text.)  Focus on what’s most important and remember to use the Model of your choice to guide you.
