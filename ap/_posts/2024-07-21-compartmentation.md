# 2.7 Origin of Compartmen-talization and the Eukaryotic Cell

*Membranes and membrane-bound organelles in eukaryotic cells compartmentalize intracellular metabolic processes and specific enzymatic reactions.*

**To Think About:** 

What are some similarities and/or differences in compartmentalization between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?  How did mitochondria and chloroplasts evolve from previously free-living prokaryotic cells via endosymbiosis?  What is some evidence to support the claim the mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved through the process of endosymbiosis?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- What is an advantage of cellular compartmentalization?
- How does compartmentalization help the functioning of the lysosome?
- How does membrane folding help the mitochondria and the chloroplast perform their functions?
- If a viral infection leads to the disruption of the lysosome membrane, predict the effect on the cell?  Justify your prediction.

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- What is the function of the plasma membrane in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
- Prokaryotic cells have an internal region called the ______________ which contain its genetic material, but eukaryotes have a membrane bound ________________ which contain genetic material.
- Which eukaryotic membrane bound organelle is thought to have evolved from infoldings of the plasma membrane?
- Which eukaryotic membrane bound organelles are thought to have evolved from the process of endosymbiosis?
- Describe the process of endosymbiosis.
- Describe three pieces of evidence that mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved from endosymbiosis.
