# 5.1-2 Meiosis and Genetic Diversity

*Gamete formation involves a type of cell division called meiosis. This type of cell division reduces the number of sets of chromosomes from two in the parent cell to one in each gamete, counterbalancing the doubling that occurs at fertilization.*

**To Think About:** 

What is the difference between diploid and haploid?
What is the purpose of meiosis?
What happens in the series of steps that make up meiosis?
What similarities and differences are there between mitosis and meiosis?
What is crossing over, and how does it increase genetic diversity?
When does random assortment of chromosomes in meiosis increase genetic diversity?
How does fertilization increase genetic diversity?
