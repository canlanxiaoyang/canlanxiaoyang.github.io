# 2.4 Cell Membranes

*In fluid mosaic model, the membrane is a mosaic of protein molecules bobbing in a fluid bilayer of phospholipids.*

**To Think About:** 

How does the structure of a phospholipid establish and maintain the internal environment of the cell?  What role do phospholipids have in maintaining the internal environment of the cell?  What role do proteins have in maintaining the internal environment of the cell?  What is the structural framework of the Fluid Mosaic Model of cell membranes?  How does the structure of cell membranes result in selective permeability?  How do cell membranes separate the internal environment of the cell from the external environment?  What is the direct consequence of membrane structure, as described by the fluid mosaic model?  What type of molecules passes freely across the membrane?  What type of substances moves across the membrane through embedded channels and transport proteins?  What molecules pass through the membrane in small amounts?  What type of boundaries do cell walls provide?  What types of molecules are the cell walls of plants, prokaryotes, and fungi composed of?

- Why are phospholipids amphipathic?
- Where are peripheral proteins found?
- What type of embedded proteins span the cell membrane?
- Why do peripheral proteins have amino acids with hydrophilic side (R) groups but integral proteins have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic side (R) groups?
- List the six functions of transmembrane proteins.
- What does the “fluid mosaic model” mean?
- What is the role of cholesterol in cell membranes?
- Why are carbohydrates important in cell membranes?  Where can these carbohydrates be found?
