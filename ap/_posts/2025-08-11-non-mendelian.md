# 5.4-5 Non-Mendelian Genetics

*In the 1900s, geneticists extended Mendelian principles not only to diverse organisms, but also to patterns of inheritance more complex than those described by Mendel.*

**To Think About:** 

What are linked genes?
What does map distance tell you about a pair of linked genes?
What are sex-linked traits?
How do sex-linked traits differ from Mendelian traits?
How does inheritance determined by multiple genes differ from Mendelian inheritance?
How does non-nuclear inheritance differ from Mendelian inheritance?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- What are linked genes?  How are linked genes and sex-linked genes different?
- What type of experimental evidence would identify linked genes?
- The probability that linked genes will segregate together is called the <u>_____</u>  <u>______</u>
- How is map distance calculated?
- If the map distance between genes A and B is 30 is map units, and the map distance between genes C and D is 10 map units, between which pair of genes would you expect to find a greater recombination frequency?
- True or false: Sex linked chromosomes are non-homologous
- Why are females more likely to be carriers for sex-linked recessive traits than males?
- How would a pedigree for a sex-linked recessive trait be different from a pedigree for an autosomal recessive trait?
- If crossing over is occurring between genes, we would expect to see phenotypes that are <u>____________</u>  <u>___________</u> the parent phenotypes.
- PAUSE the video at 6:39!!!  Do it!! Ok, thank you. In the skill practice question at 6:39 in the video, what is the TOTAL number of offspring that are the result of cross over events? (Look for the offspring whose phenotypes are different from the parental phenotypes)
- Now that you know the TOTAL number of offspring that are the result of cross over events, divide that number by the number of crosses (5) to find the mean number of cross over events, which is…………

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- Human hair color is an example of a trait determined by <u>__________</u>   <u>__________</u>
- If three genes determined an organisms hair color (A, B, and C), which genotype would result in the darkest colored hair? 
- Which genotype would result in the lightest colored hair?  Which genotype would help Ms. Wuerth get rid of all the grey hair she has acquired in the past year? (Just kidding on that one, when hair salons are allowed to reopen my hairdresser will fix that for me :)
- What are the two organelles that contribute to non-nuclear inheritance?  Why can these organelles do non-nuclear inheritance?
- Traits that are coded for by genes in the mitochondria are transmitted by <u>______</u> not <u>_______</u>, so <u>_____________</u> can pass these genes on to their offspring, but <u>____________</u> cannot pass these genes on to their offspring.
