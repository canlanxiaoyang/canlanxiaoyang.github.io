# 6.5 Regulation of Gene Expression

*All organisms, whether prokaryotes or eukaryotes, must regulate which genes are expressed at any given time. Both unicellular organisms and the cells of multicellular organisms continually turn genes on and off in response to signals from their external and internal environments.*

**To Think About:** 

What is gene expression? What types of interactions regulate gene expression? What is epigenetics? How is the phenotype of a cell or organism influenced by differential gene expression? How does the location of regulatory sequences relate to their 
function? What is an operon? Why is the lac operon an inducible operon?
