# 1.4 Protein

*Proteins are all constructed from the same set of 20 amino acids, linked in unbranched polymers. The bond between amino acids is called a peptide bond, so a polymer of amino acids is called a polypeptide. A protein is a biologically functional molecule made up of one or more polypeptides, each folded and coiled into a specific threedimensional structure.*

**To Think About:** 

What is the directionality of the subunits of Proteins?  What are the four elements of protein structure?  How may a change in the subunits of a protein lead to changes in structure or function?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

-  To which functional group are new amino acids added when forming peptide bonds?
- Complete this table：

| Level Protein Structure | Definition | Which bonds or forces cause this level of structure to form? |
|:----------------:|:---------------:|:-------------------------------:|
| Primary | 		       |                                  |
| Secondary			| 		       |                                  |
| Tertiary	| 		       |                                 |	
| Quatenary			  | 		       |                                  |

- How do the R-groups on amino acids influence protein folding?
- How would substituting a polar amino acid for a nonpolar amino acid affect a protein’s structure and function?
