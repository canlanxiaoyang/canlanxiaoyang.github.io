# 6.7 Mutations

*Alterations in a DNA sequence can lead to changes in the type or amount of the protein produced and the consequent phenotype. DNA mutations can be positive, negative, or neutral based on the effect or the lack of effect they have on the resulting nucleic acid or protein and the phenotypes that are conferred by the protein.*

**To Think About:** 

What is a mutation? What are the various gene mutations? What effect do mutations have on nucleic acids or proteins and phenotypes? How does a DNA mutation occur? How do errors during mitosis or meiosis result in changes in the phenotype of a cell or organism? What determines whether a mutation is detrimental, beneficial, or neutral? How are changes in genotype subject to natural selection? What are horizontal acquisitions of genetic information? What reproduction processes increase genetic variation?
How are changes in genotype subject to natural selection? What are horizontal acquisitions of genetic information? What reproduction processes increase genetic variation?

- <u>_______________</u>  in genes or gene products can result in new <u>_______________</u>
- Using what you know about the genetic code, explain why some mutations do NOT result in a change to the protein.
- How are the effects of substitution mutations different from the effects of deletion or insertion mutations?
- STOP Pause the video at 6:46 and explain why the mutation described in that question still results in black spots.
