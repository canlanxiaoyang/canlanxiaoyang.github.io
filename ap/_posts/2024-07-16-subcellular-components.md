# 2.2 Subcellular Components of Eukaryotes

*Cells—the basic structural and functional units of every organism—are of two distinct types: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Organisms of the domains Bacteria and Archaea consist of prokaryotic cells. Organisms of the domain Eukarya—protists, fungi, animals, and plants—all consist of eukaryotic cells.*

**To Think About:** 

How do ribosomes reflect the common ancestry of all known life?  What is the structure and function of the following subcellular organelles; ribosomes, rough ER, smooth ER, Golgi complex, mitochondria, lysosomes, a vacuole, and chloroplasts?
