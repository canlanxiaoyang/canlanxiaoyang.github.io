# 3.4 Photosynthesis

*The conversion process that transforms the energy of sunlight into chemical energy stored in sugars and other organic molecules is called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis nourishes almost the entire living world directly or indirectly.*

**To Think About:** 

How do organisms capture and store energy for use in biological processes? How are the light-dependent reactions involved in the capturing and transforming of energy? What are the products of the light-dependent reactions? How are the light-dependent reactions and Calvin cycle reactions related? What is chlorophyll's role in boosting electron energy levels? How do photosystem I and II (PSI and PSII) work together to create a proton gradient which facilitates ATP synthesis? How are products of the light-dependent reactions used in the Calvin cycle?
