# 8.4 Effect of Density of Populations

*A birth rate or death rate that does not change with population density is density independent. If a death rate increases or a birth rate decreases with increasing density, it is density dependent.*

**To Think About:** 

In what ways are living systems organized in a hierarchy of structural levels that interact?
What would cause a population to produce a density of individuals that exceeds the system's resource availability?
What causes a population to display a logistic growth?
