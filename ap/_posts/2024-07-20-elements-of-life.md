# Elements of Life

1. To Think About: Why do living systems require a constant input of energy?  Why must living systems exchange matter with the environment?  What role does carbon have in the building of biological macromolecules?  What roles does nitrogen have in building biological macromolecules?  What role does phosphorus play in the building of biological macromolecules?  What are some key properties of monomers?  What type of bond connects monomers in biological macromolecules?  What are dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis reactions?

2. Watch: AP Daily Video Elements of Life and Answer the Following Questions:
    - Give three reasons living organisms need energy
    - Complete the following table:

    | Molecule | Contains carbon | Contains nitrogen | Contains phosphorus |
    |:--------:|:---------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------:|
    | Carbohydrates | 		       |                   |                     |
    | Proteins			| 		       |                   |                     |
    | Nucleic acids	| 		       |                   |                     |	
    | Lipids			  | 		       |                   |                     |

    - (Not in video) Which of the four biological molecules contains sulfur?
    - Describe three different types of carbon skeletons.
