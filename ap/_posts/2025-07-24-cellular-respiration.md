# 3.3 Cellular Respiration

*Respiration breaks the fuel down, using oxygen and generating ATP. The waste products of this type of respiration, carbon dioxide and water (H2O), are the raw materials for photosynthesis.*

**To Think About:** 

What processes do all forms of life use to produce ATP? How do eukaryotes coordinate cellular respiration? How is an electrochemical/proton gradient formed during cell respiration? What is the function of the electron transport chain? What is the role of NADH and FADH2? How does the electrochemical / proton gradient power ATP synthase? What is oxidative phosphorylation? What is the importance of decoupling during respiration? What is the purpose of glycolysis? What is the fate of pyruvate? What are the products of Krebs cycle (The Citric Acid cycle)? What happens to the electrons extracted in glycolysis and Krebs cycle (The Citric Acid cycle)? How does fermentation differ from aerobic cellular respiration? How is energy released from ATP?
