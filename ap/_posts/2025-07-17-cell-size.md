# 2.3 Cell and Organism Size

*The surface-to-volume ratio is an important parameter affecting cell size and shape.*

**To Think About:** 

Why are cells typically small?  How is the surface area to volume ratio calculated?  What are some examples of structural modifications of cells that increase surface area?  How does the surface area to volume ratio affect the rate of heat exchange with the environment?  How are specialized structures and strategies used by cells and organisms for the efficient exchange of molecules with the environment?
