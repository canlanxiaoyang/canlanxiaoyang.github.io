# 4.6 Regulation of the Cell Cycle

*Levels of proteins called cyclins increase and decrease during the cell cycle. Cyclins were discovered in studies of mitosis in sea urchin gametes.*

**To Think About:** 

What are cell cycle checkpoints?
What is the role of checkpoints in regulating the cell cycle?
How are proteins are involved in checkpoints?
What happens if the cell cycle is disrupted?
