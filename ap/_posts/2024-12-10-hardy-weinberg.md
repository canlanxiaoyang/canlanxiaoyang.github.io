# 7.4 Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

*When certain conditions are met, allele and genotype frequencies do not change, a state called the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. “Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium”:  Refers to an idealized, non-evolving population.*

**To Think About:** 

What is the Hardy-Weinberg model?
What are the conditions under which allele and genotype frequencies will change in populations?
How are allele and genotype frequencies calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg Equations?
What do changes in allele frequency provide evidence for?
What are the impacts on the population if any of the conditions of Hardy-Weinberg are not met?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- What is the Hardy-Weinberg model used to describe?
- List the five conditions necessary for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
- p2 + 2pq + q2 is used to determine <u>__________________________________</u>
- p + q = 1 is used to determine <u>____________________________</u>
- Changes in allele frequencies provide evidence for <u>______________________</u>
- Describe five factors that can disrupt the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
- If p = 0.2, and q = 0.8, give the frequencies of the following:
