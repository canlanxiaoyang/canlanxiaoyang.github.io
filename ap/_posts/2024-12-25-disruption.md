# 8.7 Discruptions of Ecosystems 

*The long-term objective of restoration is to return an ecosystem as much as possible to its predisturbance state. Two key strategies are employed in restoration: bioremediation and biological augmentation.*

**To Think About:** 

In what way does naturally occurring diversity among and between components within biological systems affect interactions with the environment?  
In what way does the environment interact with random or preexisting variation in populations? 
In what ways are competition and cooperation important aspects of biological systems?
How does the environment interact with random or pre-existing variations in populations?
How do invasive species affect ecosystem dynamics?
What human activities lead to changes in ecosystem structure and/or dynamics?
How do geological and meteorological activities lead to changes in ecosystem structure and/or dynamics?
