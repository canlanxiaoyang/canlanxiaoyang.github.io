# 5.7 Chromosomal Inheritance

*Chromosomal inheritance can result in mutations that increase genetic diversity but can also cause genetic disorders. Sexual reproduction can increase genetic diversity by creating offspring with extra or missing chromosomes.*

**To Think About:** 

How does the law of segregation account for genetic variation?
How does independent assortment result in genetic variation?
What is nondisjunction and how does it contribute to genetic variation?
How does fertilization in sexually reproducing organisms lead to genetic variation?
What effect does chromosomal inheritance have on genetic variation and human disorders?
How can chromosomal inheritance show patterns of transmission of genes from parents to offspring?
How can human genetic disorders be based on chromosomal inheritance?
How can we use visual representations to analyze changes or disruptions in chromosomal inheritance?

**Watch: AP Daily Video One Chromosomal Inheritance**

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- What is the law of segregation?
- How does segregation of alleles contribute to genetic variation?
- What is the law of independent assortment?
- How does the independent assortment of chromosomes lead to genetic variation?
- How does random fertilization contribute to genetic variation?
- <u>______________________</u> contribute to genetic diversity in offspring.
- What is nondisjunction?  What is the result of a nondisjunction event?
- Pause the video at 6:30.  Predict the most likely cause of the karyotype illustrated in the question. 

**Watch: AP Daily Video Two Chromosomal Inheritance**

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- Genetic disorders can be a result of a single <u>________________</u>  <u>____________</u> (for example sickle cell disease) or the result of a specific <u>_________________</u> change  (for example Down Syndrome) passed from parents to offspring. 
- What causes Huntington’s Disease?  What is its inheritance pattern?
- Pause the video at 4:30.  If a woman who is heterozygous for hemophilia has children with a man who has normal clotting function, and they have a daughter, what is the daughter’s chance of having hemophilia?  If the same couple has a son, what is the son’s chance of having hemophilia?  (NOTE: this is a different question than the one asked in the video! Draw a punnett square to help you answer this question).
