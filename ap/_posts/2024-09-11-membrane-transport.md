# 2.5 Membrane Transport

*Passive transport is diffusion of a substance across a membrane with no energy investment. Active transport uses energy to move solutes against their gradients. Bulk transport across the plasma membrane occurs by exocytosis and endocytosis.*

**To Think About:** 

How are molecules passively transported across a membrane? How are molecules actively transported across a membrane?  How does active transport move molecules across the membrane?  How are large molecules and large amounts of molecules transported across a membrane?  Why are membrane proteins required for diffusion of certain molecules?  How do large quantities of water move across the membrane?  How do membranes become polarized?  What molecules are necessary for active transport to occur?  When is metabolic energy (such as ATP) needed for transport of molecules across the membrane?  How does Na+/K+ ATPase contribute to membrane potential?   How is water passively transported across a membrane?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- Large quantities of water can pass through special membrane proteins called ______________
- Active transport uses carrier proteins called _______________ and help establish and maintain ___________________ ______________________
- __________________  uses the energy from an electrochemical gradient to transport two different ions across the cell membrane.  If the two ions are transported in the same direction, it is called _______________, if the two ions are transported in opposite directions, it is called __________________
- The movement of ions across the cell membrane may result in the creation of an ______________________________  gradient. This gradient results in a membrane potential or voltage across the membrane.
- The sodium-potassium pump uses ATP to pump three ____________ ions out of the cell for every two __________________ ions it pumps into the cell.  This creates a __________________  ___________________.
- If ADH secretion is inhibited, what would be the result?
