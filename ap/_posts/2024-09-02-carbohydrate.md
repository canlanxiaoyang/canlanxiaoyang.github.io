# 1.3 Carbohydrates and Lipids

*Carbohydrates include sugars and polymers of sugars. The simplest carbohydrates are the monosaccharides, or simple sugars; these are the monomers from which more complex carbohydrates are built. Disaccharides are double sugars, consisting of two monosaccharides joined by a covalent bond. Carbohydrate macromolecules are polymers called polysaccharides,composed of many sugar building blocks. Lipids are the one class of large biological molecules that does not include true polymers, and they are generally not big enough to be considered macromolecules.*

**To Think About:** 

What is the directionality of the subunits of carbohydrates?  How may a change in the subunits of carbohydrates lead to changes in its structure or function?
