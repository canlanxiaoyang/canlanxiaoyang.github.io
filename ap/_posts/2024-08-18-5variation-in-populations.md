**Answer the Following Questions:**

- The ability of a population to respond to changes in the environment is influenced by <u>____________________</u>   <u>__________________</u>
- Populations with little genetic diversity are more likely to <u>_______________</u> in size or become <u>_________________</u>
- Why are populations that are more genetically diverse more likely to survive environmental changes?
- Whether or not an allele or a phenotype provides an advantage to the organism depends on the <u>____________________</u>.  If the <u>_____________________</u> changes, a previously advantageous allele can become disadvantageous.
