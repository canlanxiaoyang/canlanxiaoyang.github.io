# 4.1 Cell Communication

*Cells communicate by sending and receiving chemical messengers. Cells can communicate over various distances*

**To Think About:** 

How do cells communicate with other cells over short distances? 
How do cells communicate with other cells over long distances? 
How is the process of distance communication different from the process of communicating during cell-cell contact?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

This video talks about three types of cell communication: direct-contact, short distance, and long distance communication.  Make sure you can explain how all three methods of cell communication work, and an example of each one.

-	When unicellular organisms are in direct contact with each other, they may live together in <u>_______________</u> and share <u>_______________</u>
-	Adjacent cells may send signals to each other through modifications of their cell membranes or cell walls.  Examples of this in plants are <u>____________________</u>, examples of this in animals are <u>____________</u> <u>____________________</u>
-	To communicate or short or long distances, cells use <u>_________</u> <u>____________</u>
-	These chemical signals are received by cells called <u>___________</u> cells.
-	Cells communicate over short distances by sending out signals called <u>_______</u>  <u>_____________</u>.  This is often used in cells of the <u>__________</u>  type
-	Long distance cell communication is often used in cells of <u>__________</u> types.
-	B-cell activation requires <u>_____</u> to <u>_____</u> contact.  In B-cell an anitgen on one cell binds to a <u>_______________</u> on a B-cell.
-	Neurotransmitters communicate using <u>_______</u>   <u>___________________</u>
-	In the practice question at the end of the video, which mechanism best explains how a hormone can reach target cells far away in the body?
