# 7.5 Evidence of Common Ancestry and Evolution

*Biogeography provides information about the evolutionary history of organisms, specifically where they originated and how they were able to disperse.*

**To Think About:** 

What evidence supports evolution?
How are fossils dated?
How do morphological homologies provide evidence for common ancestry?
How do fundamental molecular and cellular features shared across all domains of life provide evidence of common ancestry?
What evidence supports relatedness of organisms in all domains?
What structural evidence supports common ancestry of all eukaryotes?
