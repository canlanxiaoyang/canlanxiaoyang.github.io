# 4.2 Signal Transduction

*Signal Transduction pathways differ in specific details, but have certain, unifying characteristics. All pathways follow a sequence: Reception，Transduction, Response*

**To Think About:** 

What is a signal transduction pathway?
Why do cells use signal transduction pathways?
How does a signal transduction pathway begin?
What is the role of protein modification in signal transduction pathways?
What is the role of phosphorylation cascades in signal transduction pathways?
What role does the environment play in eliciting cellular responses?
How are signal transduction pathways used to influence cellular responses when there are changes in the environment?

- What is reception?
- What is transduction?
- What is response?
- Many signal transduction pathways include protein <u>__________</u> and <u>___________</u> <u>_______________</u>  Examples of this include:
a.	Regulating protein synthesis by <u>________________</u> in the nucleus
b.	Regulating activity of proteins in the <u>________________</u>
c.	<u>________________</u> of molecular interactions that send signals from receptors to <u>____________</u>  <u>___________________</u>
d.	Phosphorylation cascades that <u>______________________________________</u>
- Key to the binding of a ligand to a receptor is <u>______________________</u>
- When a ligand binds to a G-protein coupled receptor, GDP is converted into  <u>_________</u>, this then can activate other proteins in the cell (the example shows the protein <u>____________</u>   <u>______________</u> being activated) 
- Signaling cascades can <u>___________________</u> signals, increasing the effect of the ligand.
- cAMP (cyclic AMP) is an example of a <u>__________________</u>  messenger
- When the ligand binds, the intracellular (inside the cell) domain of the receptor protein changes <u>___________</u>, which starts the <u>___________________</u> of the signal.
- Ligand-gated ion channels may <u>_____________</u> or <u>___________</u> when the ligand binds.
- Draw the picture showing the difference between the protein ligand signal transduction pathway and the steroid ligand signal transduction pathway.
- What is the major difference between the protein and steroid signal transduction pathway?
- In the multiple choice question at the end of the video, what describes the role of metfomin in the signal transduction pathway?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- Signal transduction pathways are important because they allow cells to respond to changes in their <u>____________________</u>
- In the example with epinephrine, the binding of epinephrine to its <u>___________</u> ultimately leads to the breakdown of <u>__________________</u> leading to increased levels of <u>______________</u> being available to the cell.
- Signaling pathways that target gene expression can alter the amount or types of <u>_____________________</u> in a cell.
- Programmed cell death (also known as <u>____________________</u>) can also be a result of signal transduction
- <u>_____________</u>   <u>_____________________</u> allows bacteria to detect changes in population density.
- Why would some cells respond to the ligand epinephrine while other cells do not?
