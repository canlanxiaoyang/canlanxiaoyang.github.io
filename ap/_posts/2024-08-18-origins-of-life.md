# 7.11 Origins of Life on Earth

*Two major hypothesis for life on Earth. Panspermia:  Life from extraterrestrial life. Abiogenesis:  Life from non-life. Requires 4 major milestones to occur.*

**To Think About:** 

What scientific evidence provides support for models of the origin of life on Earth?
What are the models for the origin of life on Earth?
What is the RNA World Hypothesis?

---

**Watch: AP Daily Video Origins of Life on Earth**

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- How long ago did Earth form? When is the earliest fossil evidence of life on Earth?
- How were oxygen levels in Earth’s early atmosphere different from oxygen levels in Earth’s atmosphere today?
- Which theory of the origin of life on Earth is supported by data from the Miller-Urey experiment?
- How could meteorites have contributed to the development of life on Earth?
- What is the RNA world hypothesis? (NOTE: recently there has been some evidence to refute this hypothesis, but it is still important that you know if for the AP Biology exam)
