# 6.4 Translation

*Translation is the synthesis of a polypeptide using the information in the mRNA. During this stage, there is a change in language: The cell must translate the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule into the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide. The sites of translation are ribosomes, molecular complexes that facilitate the orderly linking of amino acids into polypeptide chains.*

**To Think About:** 

What is translation? What are the main steps of the translation process? When does translation occur in prokaryotes? How does an alternate flow of information affect translation in retroviruses? How does the process of translation serve as evidence of common ancestry? What are the main features in each step of translation? What are the primary molecules involved in the process of translation?
