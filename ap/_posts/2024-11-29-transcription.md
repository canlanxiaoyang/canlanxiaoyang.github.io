# 6.3 Transcription and RNA Processing

*Transcription is the synthesis (production) of RNA using information in the DNA. The two nucleic acids are written in different forms of the same language, and the information is simply transcribed, or “rewritten,” from DNA to RNA.*

**To Think About:** 

What is meant by the flow of genetic information? What is transcription? What are the specific mechanisms involved in the transcription process? What are the different types of RNA molecules and what is the function of each? What are the mRNA transcript modifications that occur in eukaryotic cells? What is alternative splicing? How does alternative splicing result in different proteins?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- Describe the flow of genetic information in the cell.
a.	Where is genetic information stored?
b.	Where are proteins assembled?
c.	What connects the genetic information in the nucleus to protein synthesis in ribosomes?
- Transcription is the process by which the enzyme <u>______________________</u> forms a molecule of <u>_________</u>.
- RNA polymerase adds nucleotides in the in <u>____________</u> direction, so it reads the template DNA strand in the <u>_______________</u> direction.
- Other names for the template DNA strand are <u>_______________</u>  or  <u>_____________</u> or <u>______________</u>.
- Describe the function of the three types of RNA molecules in the video
- What is the difference between a codon and an anticodon?
- STOP the video at 5:46!  Write out your answer to the question here (not just A, B, C or D, write out the answer in words!)
- Often it helps your learning if you explain why the incorrect answers are wrong. Below explain why answer choices A and B in the previous question are incorrect - use complete sentences in your answer.

- What modification is made to the 5’ end of the mRNA transcript?  What purposes does it serve?
- Explain the difference between introns and exons.
- How does alternative splicing lead to different proteins from the same gene?
- STOP! Pause the video at 4:55, write out your answer to the question here:
