# 7.7 Phylogeny

*Phylogeny is the evolutionary history of a species or group of related species. The discipline of systematics classifies organisms and determines their evolutionary relationships.*

**To Think About:** 

What are phylogenetic trees and cladograms?
How are phylogenetic trees and cladograms used to infer evolutionary relationships?
How are phylogenetic trees and cladograms constructed?
What is a shared, derived characteristic?
What is an outgroup, and how is it used to infer evolutionary relationships?
What is the most accurate and reliable evidence when constructing phylogenetic trees and cladograms?
How do phylogenetic trees and cladograms illustrate speciation?
Why are phylogenetic trees and cladograms constantly being revised?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- What is do phylogenetic trees and cladograms have in common? What is the difference between them?
- What is a clade?
- What do shared derived characters indicate?
- What is an outgroup?
- What does a node represent on a phylogenetic tree?  What does the root represent?
- What kind of data can be used to construct a phylogenetic tree?  Which type of data is usually more accurate?
- What is a derived character?
- STOP the video at 5:09, draw your cladogram here and circle the species that is the outgroup
