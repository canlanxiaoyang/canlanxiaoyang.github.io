# 6.2 DNA Replication

*Watson and Crick’s model predicts that when a double helix replicates, each of the two daughter molecules will have one old strand, from the parental molecule, and one newly made strand.*

**To Think About:** 

What is the purpose of DNA replication? What does it mean for the replication process to be semiconservative? How does the directionality of a DNA molecule influence the replication process? What are the specific enzymes involved in replication and what is the function of each?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- What is the purpose of DNA replication?
- What does “semiconservative” replication mean?
- How is the 5’ terminus different from the 3’ terminus of DNA?
- What does antiparallel mean?
- Because new nucleotides can only be added in the 5’ to 3’ direction, one strand is called the leading strand and is synthesized <u>______________________</u> and the other strand is called the lagging strand and is synthesized <u>__________________________________</u>.
- Describe the function of each of the following enzymes in DNA replication:

a.	Helicase
b.	Topoisomerase
c.	DNA polymerase
d.	Ligase
- How are the functions of helicase and topoisomerase related?
