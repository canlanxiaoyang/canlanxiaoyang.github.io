# 2.6 Water Movement: Osmosis, Tonicity, and Osmoregulation

*The diffusion of free water across a selectively permeable membrane, whether artificial or cellular, is called osmosis.*

**To Think About:** 

What are the different ways to describe the relative tonicity of environments?  How do differences in osmolarity impact the movement of water in a cell?  How does the constant movement of molecules across a membrane maintain growth and homeostasis?  What is osmoregulation and how does it contribute to the health and survival of organisms?  How does water potential impact the movement of water?  How does solute potential impact the movement of water?  How do organisms maintain water balance?
