# 8.1 Responses to Environment

*Ecology is the scientific study of the interactions between organisms and the environment. These interactions determine both the distribution of organisms and their abundance.*

**To Think About:** 

Why do organisms respond to changes in their environment?
How do organisms exchange information with one another?
How can an organism's signaling behavior produce changes in behavior of other organisms and affect reproductive success?
What types of signals do animals use to indicate dominance, find food, establish territory, and ensure reproductive success?
What types of behavior does natural selection favor?
How does cooperative behavior impact individual fitness and survival of a population?
How does timing and coordination of biological mechanisms involved in growth, reproduction, and homeostasis depend on organisms responding to environmental clues?
How does the transmission of information result in changes within and between biological systems?
