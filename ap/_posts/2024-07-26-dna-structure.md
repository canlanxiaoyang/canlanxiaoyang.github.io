# 6.1 DNA Structure

*The elegant double-helical structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) shook the scientific world when it was proposed in April 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick. The DNA you inherited from your parents contains all your genes—your genetic information.*

**To Think About:** 

What is the source of heritable information found in cells? What are the characteristics of DNA and RNA that allow them both to be used as hereditary material? What differences exist between the heritable information found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes?
