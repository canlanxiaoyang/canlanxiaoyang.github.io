# 4.3 Changes in Signal Transduction Pathways

*Food and drugs can be sources of chemicals that act as exogenous ligands in cell communication. Exogenous ligands can disrupt the usual activity of a signal transduction pathway, thereby altering the responses of target cells.*

**To Think About:** 

How can mutations in the receptor protein or any component of the signaling pathway affect the transduction of a signal?
How can chemicals activate a pathway?
How can chemicals inhibit a pathway?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- If a mutation occurs in the gene for a receptor protein that causes a change in its structure, it would also change its <u>_______________</u>, a possible results is that the <u>________________</u> would no longer bind to the receptor and the signaling pathway would be <u>_________________</u>
- A disruption in a signaling pathway would effect subsequent steps, also called <u>_____________________</u> reactions.
- When fibroblast growth factor binds to a receptor, it will <u>___________________</u> a signaling pathway.
- Inhibitors that block the release of neurotransmitters will block any <u>_____________</u> with the <u>______________</u> cell. 
NOTE:  The correct answer to the practice question at the end of this video is NOT C,  the correct answer is B
- Explain why the loss of function of the intracellular domain of the insulin receptor protein would be increased storage of GLUT4 in vesicles inside the cell.
