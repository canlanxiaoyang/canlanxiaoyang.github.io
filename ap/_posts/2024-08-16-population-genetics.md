# 7.3 Population Genetics

*Natural selection acts on individuals, but only populations evolve. Genetic variations in populations contribute to evolution.*

**To Think About:** 

What factors drive evolution?
How do mutations contribute to natural selection?
How does genetic drift impact population size?
How does the reduction of genetic variation impact populations of the same species?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- Mutations are <u>________________</u> changes in an organism’s DNA sequence
- What do mutations create in a population?
- What is genetic drift?
- In what size populations is genetic drift more likely to occur?
- One type of genetic drift is a bottleneck event. Describes what happens in a bottleneck event.
- Another type of genetic drift is the founder effect. Describes what could create a founder effect.
- Migration (also known as <u>______</u>  <u>_______</u>) can introduce new <u>________</u> into a population.
- Continued migration between populations can also <u>_______________</u>  genetic diversity/differences between populations over time.
- The raw material of evolution is <u>______________________</u>
- Fitness depends on <u>_________________</u>
- What would be the effect on evolution if there was no genetic variation in a population?
- What is a null hypothesis?
- What is an experimental hypothesis?
- STOP Pause the video at 4:12, what is the NULL hypothesis in the give scenario?
