# 4.5 The Cell Cycle

*Mitosis is just one part of the cell cycle, the life of a cell from the time it is first formed during division of a parent cell until its own division into two daughter cells*

**To Think About:** 

What is the role of interphase?
What occurs during interphase?
What is the role of mitosis?
What occurs during mitosis?
What is the role of cytokinesis?
What occurs during prophase?
What occurs during metaphase?
What occurs during anaphase?
What occurs during telophase?
When does cytokinesis occur?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- Daughter cells carry genomes <u>____________________</u> to the parent cells.
- Fill in the following table regarding the events of mitosis:

| PHASE | Events |
|:---------------:|:-------------------------------:|
| Prophase | 		       |                                  |
| Metaphase			| 		       |                                  |
| Anaphase	| 		       |                                 |	
| Telophase			  | 		       |                                  |

- Division of the cytoplasm into two daughter cells is called <u>_______________________</u>.
