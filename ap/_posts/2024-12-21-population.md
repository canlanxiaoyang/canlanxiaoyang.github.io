# 8.3 Population Ecology

*Population ecology is the study of factors affecting the size of a population and how it changes over time.*

**To Think About:** 

What is a population?
What factors influence population growth dynamics?
What leads to the exponential growth of a population?  
In what ways are living systems organized in a hierarchy of structural levels that interact?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- What is a population?
- The size of a population largely depends on <u>_________________</u>
- How does food availability affect reproduction and survival rates?
- What are some adaptations that aid in survival when energy availability decreases?
- List some factors that affect population growth.
- If B > D the population growth rate will <u>______________</u>, if B < D the population growth rate will <u>__________________</u>
- What conditions lead to exponential growth?
- What would a graph of the population size in a population experiencing exponential growth look like?
- What would a graph of the population size in a population experiencing logistic growth look like?
- Stop the video at 3:04. What is the growth rate of the population in the question? Show your work.
