# 7.8 Speciation

*Speciation, the origin of new species, is at the focal point of Darwin’s evolutionary theory. Evolutionary theory must explain how new species originate and how populations evolve.*

**To Think About:** 

When does speciation occur?
What is the biological species concept?
What is punctuated equilibrium?
What is gradualism?
What is divergent evolution?
What is allopatric and sympatric speciation?
How do prezygotic and postzygotic mechanisms impact speciation?
