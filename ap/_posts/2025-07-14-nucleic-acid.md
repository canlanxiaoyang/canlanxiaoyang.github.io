# 1.5 Nucleic Acids

*Nucleic acids are polymers made of monomers called nucleotides. Nucleic acids store, transmit, and help express hereditary information.*

**To Think About:** 

What is the directionality of the subunits of Nucleic Acids?  How does the directionality influence the structure and function of nucleic acid polymers?  How does directionality influence the synthesis of nucleic acid polymers?  How may a change in the subunits of nucleic acid polymers lead to changes in its structure or function?

**Answer the Following Questions:**

- The 5’ carbon in the sugar of a nucleotide has a<u>____________________</u>group attached, while the 3’ carbon in the sugar of a nucleotide has<u>____________________</u>group attached.
- Why are the two strands of the DNA double helix considered antiparallel?
- What is the number of hydrogen bonds between the base pairs of DNA?
- How does the antiparallel nature of the DNA molecule affect its replication?
- Why would a DNA segment with more AT pairs be less stable than a DNA segment with more GC pairs?
