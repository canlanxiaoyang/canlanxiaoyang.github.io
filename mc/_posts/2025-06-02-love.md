# If Time Could Stop at the Moment We Met

## Lavender Haze

As dark creeping, when day does fade,

I find your gaze, where dreams are made.

The stars above, into sparking flames,

you and I, found in lovely maze.

Twilight merged, immerse your eye,

the melody engaged, brings me delight.

Two souls entwined, shaped a perfect sight,   

Together, we lost in sweety dive.


Whisper through the gleaming night,

winds touch prior cause of shy,

down the roads with hands held tight,

dreams take flight, as stars comply.

Main River along, promise made,

sixpence tragedy will never behave.

Inside lavender haze we'll stay,

heart-lock bond, come what may.

## Be all at sea

Promises once bright as sunshine,

but dimmed and missed within the infinite night.

Wander through the remnants of time,

when love once danced, came to silent strife.

Each memory that dominant my mind,

leads to deceivable dreams, where solace hard to find.

The stars we wished upon fade from sight,

shimmers now replaced by doubts that cloud the night.

So far away that I can't reach your eyes,

the light I chased, was merely a lie.

So what is the cost of craving without gain?

A smile beamed, now elapsed in endless pain.
