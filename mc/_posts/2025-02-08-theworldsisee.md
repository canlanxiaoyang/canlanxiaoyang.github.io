# The Worlds I See: A Human Touch Behind Technologies

The Worlds I See, the memoir of Dr. Li Fei-Fei, one of the leaders in this era of artificial intelligence known for establishing [ImageNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet), is a masterfully interwoven narrative of the _human_ behind what we know as artificial intelligence nowadays. She weaves together technology and her personal life in such an inspiring way that it deeply resonates with me.

I wish to highlight one aspect of the book that touched me the most—not the history of the technology, but Li Fei-Fei's _human_ journey as an immigrant and in technology—not only because it is profoundly powerful, but also because (1) I am about to step on the journey of an international student myself, and (2) I am eagerly exploring the boundaries between technology and humanity myself.

In the late 1980s, as she was just graduating primary school, her parents decided that they would move to America. This was such an unbelievably courageous decision. The late 1980s was a time of instability in China, and traveling abroad was nearly impossible without government approval. Li's family had little opportunity for advancement. Yet, against all odds, they chose a different path. They chose to reclaim their identity.

Adjusting to life in America was daunting. She grappled with a language barrier, her mother struggled with health issues, and her family faced abject poverty.

Then she met Bob Sabella, her high school math teacher, who became a guiding light while Fei-Fei was facing a new world with infinite possibilities but also all-devouring difficulties. Bob Sabella was the only person who would talk with and understand Fei-Fei. The Sabellas didn't just support her academically—they helped her family financially, even funding their family washing business just to give them a foothold in life. With their help, Fei-Fei persevered. She received an almost full-ride scholarship to Princeton. It's the human _connection_ that enabled her to chase her dreams.

After graduating, she pursued a career in academia. At a time when most researchers are singly focused on improving machine learning models, she believed in the power of data. She spearheaded the ImageNet project, an ambitious effort to build a vast dataset for AI to recognize objects in images. Although it was faced with skepticism and a severe lack of funding, it eventually became the foundation for the rejuvenation of computer vision. She laid the groundwork for today's AI breakthroughs.

Years later, Fei-Fei realized that AI could not be solely about technological advancement—it had to serve _people_. In one project, she attempted to introduce AI into medical settings to encourage healthcare workers to wash their hands. Instead, she faced backlash. It was an alarm: AI must consider human concerns, like privacy, autonomy, and trust.

Li Fei-Fei coined the term "human-centered AI" and co-founded the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). Her mission is to advance AI to improve the human condition. She inspired me with my own aspirations.

Every person has the freedom and opportunity to succeed and attain a better life, no matter who they are, what they believe, or where they are from. That's the American Dream. As an immigrant, Li Fei-Fei went on to testify before Congress as a distinguished scholar on the development of AI and its ethical implications. Through relentless effort, she built a future that once seemed unattainable. She achieved the American Dream.

As I prepare for my own journey, I can't help but wonder—how will I shape my own dream?
