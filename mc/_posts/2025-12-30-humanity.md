# Learning from Practice: 

How I Built an Activity Project through BAID Humanity Club

Organizing a meaningful activity is not simply about creativity or enthusiasm. Through my experience founding and running the BAID Humanity Club, I gradually learned that a successful project requires observation, research, teamwork, and reflection. This essay shares the key steps and insights I gained from turning an idea into a sustainable activity.

**1. Starting with Observation: Finding Ideas from Everyday Life**

The first step of any activity is forming an idea, and I believe that good ideas always come from careful observation of our surroundings. Instead of pursuing grand or abstract goals, I focused on the real needs of people around me and the relationship between individuals, the community, and nature.

By paying attention to small but concrete problems in daily life, I realized that meaningful change does not have to be dramatic. Even small actions, if well designed, can improve a community. More importantly, the project should be something that I could realistically contribute to with my own abilities and resources.

**2. From Idea to Feasibility: Research and Consultation**

After developing a preliminary idea, research became essential. I started by talking to classmates and teachers to understand their opinions and concerns. I also consulted senior students with relevant experience, teachers whose expertise matched the project, and even school administrators such as the principal.

This process helped me evaluate whether the idea was truly needed, feasible within a school context, and appealing to potential participants. Through research and discussion, the initial idea became clearer, more realistic, and better structured.

**3. Proposal Writing and Team Building**

Based on the research results, I began writing a formal project proposal and preparing for a presentation to the school. At the same time, I formed a small team, with its size determined by the project’s complexity and workload. Each member took responsibility for different areas, such as planning, technical support, publicity, and execution.

The proposal included several key components:
•	The background and motivation of the project, supported by data or relevant studies
•	Research findings on feasibility and student participation willingness
•	A detailed activity plan divided into preparation, execution, and follow-up stages
•	The support needed from the school, such as schedule coordination, teacher guidance, venue arrangements, and safety
A feasibility analysis, including potential risks and corresponding solutions

This structured proposal not only improved the project’s credibility but also demonstrated responsibility and professionalism.

**4. Implementation: Promotion, Execution, and Reflection**

Once the proposal was approved, effective implementation became the priority. In the early stage, publicity was crucial. I used online platforms, in-class presentations, posters, and peer networks to ensure that as many people as possible learned about the project. Highlighting the core values and unique features of the activity helped attract genuine interest.

During execution, order and planning were essential. I created a clear timeline and progress chart, specifying what should be completed at each stage. Strictly following this plan ensured smooth operation and minimized confusion.

After the activity, reflection was equally important. Feedback was collected through questionnaires and informal discussions to identify strengths and areas for improvement. These insights provided valuable guidance for future activities.

**5. Extending Impact beyond the Activity**

A well-designed activity should not end when the event is over. After completing the project, I explored ways to expand its influence by participating in competitions, sharing experiences with others, and using media platforms such as school publications or public accounts.

By documenting and communicating the experience, the project gained a longer-lasting impact and inspired others to initiate similar activities.
