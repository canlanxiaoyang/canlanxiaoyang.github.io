# The Invisible Weight: A Visual Deconstruction of Anxiety

How can the internal sensation of anxiety be expressed through visual mediums like distortion, repetition, and claustrophobic composition? I examined how anxiety is expressed in bodily sensations, warped perception, and isolates individuals emotionally. I directed my research towards taking invisible emotional tension and making it physical by distorting mundane imagery to represent psychological instability.

I began with observation drawings of individual instances of worry, then distorted them by layering and abstracting shapes. I played with color to represent emotional intensity, progressing from muted and light tones to jarring, contrasting colors. I composed the images to achieve burgeoning tension through close framing and imbalance. In exploring relief, I employed repetition and symmetrical forms to represent efforts to soothe the turmoil.
